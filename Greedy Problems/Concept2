Celebration party Problem

Input A Set of n points x1.... xn E R
Output The Minimum number of segments of length at most 2
		needed to cover all the points

Connection with Grouping Children

1) Points x1... xn correspond to children ages
2) Segments corresponds to groups
3) Any two children within the same segment of length differ by 
at most 2 years of age
4) Any valid group of children can be put int a segment of length 2

safe choice : Cover leftmost point with a segment of length 
2 which starts in this point

Greedy algo
1 ) Cover the leftmost point with a length of 2
2) Remove all the points within this segment
3) Solve the same problem with the remaining points
