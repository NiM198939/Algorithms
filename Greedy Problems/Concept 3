Maximizing loot

Fractional Knapsack
Input : Weights w1... wn and values of v1...vn items 
Capacity W
Output : The maximum total value of fraction of items
that fit into a knapsack of capacity W.

Lemma :
There exists an optimal solution that uses as 
much as possible of an item with maximal value per unit
of weight

Algorithm
1) while knapsack is not full
2) Choose item i with maximum vi/wi
3) if item fits into knapsack, take all of it
4) otherwise take so much as to fill the knapsack
5) Return total value and amounts taken
